# ðŸ”’ Production-Grade AWS Secure Infrastructure

**Business Problem**: Organizations need infrastructure that separates 
public services from private operations while enforcing security at 
multiple layers.

**Solution**: Designed and deployed enterprise-grade AWS architecture 
with VPC isolation, multi-layer security (IGWâ†’NACLâ†’SGâ†’IAM), and 
role-based access control.

**Impact**: Zero-trust network supporting 250+ IPs per subnet with 
defense-in-depth securityâ€”production-ready in 7 days.
