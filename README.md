# ðŸ”’ Production-Grade AWS Secure Infrastructure

**Business Problem**: Organizations need infrastructure that separates 
public services from private operations while enforcing security at 
multiple layers.

**Solution**: Designed and deployed enterprise-grade AWS architecture 
with VPC isolation, multi-layer security (IGWâ†’NACLâ†’SGâ†’IAM), and 
role-based access control.

**Impact**: Zero-trust network supporting 250+ IPs per subnet with 
defense-in-depth securityâ€”production-ready in 7 days.

## Tech Stack
AWS VPC | EC2 | IAM | S3 | Security Groups | NACLs | NAT Gateway


## Project Context

**Scenario**: Deploy secure web infrastructure requiring:
- Public-facing nginx servers accessible from internet
- Private application tier isolated from direct internet access
- Separation of duties: Admins manage infrastructure, Dev group have view only access
- Cost-efficient design using AWS free tier where possible

**Success Criteria**:

âœ“ Public EC2 accessible via HTTP from anywhere

âœ“ Private EC2 accessible ONLY via public EC2 (bastion pattern)

âœ“ Private EC2 has internet access via NAT (for updates)

âœ“ Admin users control all resources, Dev users read-only to EC2

âœ“ S3 static website demonstrates multi-service integration
